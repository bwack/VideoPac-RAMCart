Here are the gerber files for G7000RAM layout version 1.1a. To build the
G7000RAM you still need the g7000ram-x.y.zip file you can download from
<http://soeren.informationstheater.de/g7000/g7000ram.html>. The G7000RAM is
a RAM Cartridge for the Videopac G7000, Videopac+ G7400 and the Odyssey^2.

The gerber files look good using Viewmate, when reading the drill file use
"left of decimal" 1 and "right of decimal" 3 as parameters. The file
names should be self explanating, group1 is solder, group2 is component
and group3 is outline.

The layout is slightly different from the version 1.1 layout, I added an
outline and fixed the drill sizes.
