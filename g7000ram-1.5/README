The G7000 RAM is a special cart designed for the Videopac G7000 / Odyssey ^ 2
video game console. It can be used to upload self-written programs into the
console via a standard RS-232C connection running at 9600 or 19200 bps. The
programs can have a size up to 12K organised in 4 banks.

WARNING: This is not a project for beginners. You have to make your own
double-sided PCB and you need an EPROM-burner to build it. If you make
mistakes, you can kill your video game console of even your PC, read this:

How to build the G7000RAM:
You have to make your own double sided PCB from my layout. For that purpose
you can use the postscript or the png files. If you need another file
format contact me and may be able to help you. The PCB is a relative simple
one for double sided, so it is doable even if you have only built single
sided PCBs before. But I don't think it is a good idea to try it if you
have no experience with PCB making. Better ask around local
computer/electronic user groups for help. The biggest problem is the
correct alignment of both sides.  When using photo transfer you can use
2 strips of PCB material to build a right-angled corner. Then you can glue
the two transparent sheets to this corner and align them. After that put
the PCB into it. Then you can expose one side after the other, you just
need to be very careful when turning the PCB over. If your method of
exposure produced a lot of heat wait with the development until the PCB is
cooled off again. Since there are no really reliable working methods to
through plate PCBs at home you have to solder a lot of pins on both sides,
this requires sockets where you can reach the pins from the top side. For
the VIAs just use a small piece of wire.

As an alternative you can download the layout in Gerber format on my
homepage and let a professional PCB maker build the PCB.

At first you should solder the 3 VIAs and the isolated jumper wire under
the EPROM. Use high quality sockets for all the ICs, this helps debugging.
Don't forget any of the solder joints on the top side if you don't plate
through the holes. Burn the file dev.rom into the 27C64 twice, or four
times if you use a 27C128.

Connecting PC and G7000RAM:
Connect the cart to a computer with a serial port which can put out data
with 9600 bps or 19200 bps with 2 stop bits, this includes PCs, Macintoshs,
Amigas, Atari STs and even C64s (at least at 9600 bps) among others. I have
tested it on PC with Linux, DOS and on Amiga. Use a standard null-modem
cable or build a special cable for the G7000RAM: connect GND to pin 5 and
TxD to pin 2. Also connect the pins RTS and CTS on the PC side. The pins
DSR, DTR, DCD have to be connected as well. Always turn on the Videopac /
Odyssey ^ 2 first, I have killed the T0 input of one 8048 while
development.

How to use it:
If the switch is open, the G7000 gets its program from the EPROM. The EPROM
contains the dev.a48 program which displays "SELECT GAME" and waits until a
key is pressed. You can now select the download speed and machine type:

key machine parameters
0   PAL     9600,N,8,1
1   PAL     19200,N,8,2
2   NTSC    9600,N,8,1
3   NTSC    19200,N,8,2

The chosen parameters are displayed on the screen, the number in the top
right edge is the release number of the firmware. Then the cart is ready to
receive 4 banks of code, each with a size of 3K. The code is put into the
RAM at 0400h-0fffh of every bank, starting with bank 0. If you don't use
bankswitching (many commercial programs are only 2K) simply output your
code 4 times through the serial port, for example the enclosed hello.obj. A
small upload tool can be found in the linux and dos directory. You can find
more examples on my home page at http://soeren.informationstheater.de. The
program uses all address lines, even A10, which is unused in nearly every
commercial cart. For every received byte the background colour changes.  After
all banks are filled, the program displays a message and plays the start sound
again. Now you can press RESET, hold it down and toggle the switch. Then you
can release RESET. The RAM is now write protected and the program in it runs.
It starts at bank 3 at 0400h. If you want to upload another program, press and
hold RESET and open the switch.  Now you can correct any bugs and upload it
again.

How does it work:
You can put any EPROM up to 16K into the EPROM socket, for example your own
programs. The lower 1K of every bank is unused, the space is occupied by
the internal BIOS. I use a 27C64 to store the download program, because its
the smallest 28 pin EPROM I can get easily and I wanted the option to use a
27C128, to make the G7000RAM usable as an EPROM cart, too. The RAM on cart
is write only, you can't read it even in download mode. To simplify the
hardware all write accesses with movx are written into the RAM, too in
download mode. So every write into VDC registers trashes RAM. But the lower
1KByte of the RAM is unused, so the problem can be solved in software. The
RS-232C data is converted to TTL via the MC1489 and put into the 8048 via
the special input T0, where it is read completely under software control
and put into the RAM. This usage of T0 makes it impossible to use the
G7000RAM together with "THE VOICE". The LS00 and LS32 control the access to
RAM and EPROM based on the position of the switch. The RAM is 32KByte,
because 16KByte SRAM in 8 bit wide is much harder to find.

Miscellaneous:
I have not found any matching enclosing for the hardware yet, if you know
where to get one, please contact me.

Since version 1.1 it is possible to use 19200 bps for upload, but you have
to send the data with 2 stop bits, the timing is too tight to work with
only 1 stop bit.

Although the main purpose of this hardware is to load your own programs,
it is possible to load ROM images for o2em with it, but remember: A10 is
not used by them, so for every bank you have to repeat the last 1KByte.

I have included in the Linux directory some shell scripts I use to assemble
with ASL and upload to the G7000RAM. The a48 script can only build programs
for 1 G7000 bank. The upload.sh script supports programs with 1, 2 or 4
G7000 banks. It takes the filename as first argument and the download speed
as second argument. The script uses the second serial port /dev/ttyS1, to
change this edit the variable SERIAL in line 4. It assumes that the user
which uses it has the necessary rights to write to the serial port,
"chmod a+rw /dev/ttyS1" is the easiest solution for PCs with only 1 user.
On systems with several users where not all of them should be able to use
the serial port you could chgrp the port to uucp and add those users to the
uucp group who are allowed to use the serial ports, but this depends on
your setup. You may need some kind of locking, too.

There is now a batch file for DOS in the dos directory. It takes a
filename, the baud rate and the size of the file as parameters. I don't
know how to find out the size of a file in DOS batches, so you have to
enter it manually. You can change the serial port in line 8, it defaults to
COM2, the second serial port.
